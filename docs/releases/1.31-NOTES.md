## Release notes for kOps 1.31 series

This is a document to gather the release notes prior to the release.

# Significant changes

* **Kubernetes minor version upgrades to 1.31 *should* be performed using a new `kops reconcile cluster` command.**

  Kubernetes 1.31 introduces stricter checks around the version-skew policy. While kOps has always followed the
  version-skew policy, there was an edge case: nodes that were added by an autoscaler during a rolling-update
  would not always follow the version-skew policy.

  See [docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md](/docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md) for more details.

# Other changes of note

* Cilium has been upgraded to v1.16.

* Spotinst cluster controller V1 is replaced with Ocean kubernetes controller V2, all old k8s resource are removed
  except spotinst-kubernetes-cluster-controller Secret.


# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.25 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.31.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.26 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.32.
